        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Easy, healthy and fast. Rice is seen as a blunt dish, I can see why, but with some veggies added in the mix, I'm yet to find somebody who can refuse such a thing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Given that it is made mainly from vegetables, its lack of meat show a healty balance for the more calories full meal served usually.
